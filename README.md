# Space_Shooter
This project is my first 2D video game made with Python.

It use the game engine <a href="https://github.com/kitao/pyxel" target="_blank"> Pyxel (by kitao)</a>

Pyxel is interesting because of it's restrictions, not much functions and it doesn't have any fancy function already implemented.
So to make a game you need to learn the basic behind the math like vector, collision, objects pool, ect.
